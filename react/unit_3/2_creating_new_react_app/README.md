## Working in App.js
- Initially React starts with boilerplate code
    - this is useful to ensure the app is running
- This code gets deleted, and replaced with functional components
    - this is similar to functional components in javascript
    - the name convention is PascalCase

```jsx
import React from "react"

const App = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    </>
  )
}

export default App
```

## Nest Components
- It is normal to have many different components working together to create a React App
- When we do, we create a 'components' directory inside the 'src' directory
    - Here we can add components like Headers, Footers, and other components
- Example: src/components/Header.js
```jsx
import React from "react"

const Header = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>Recipe Application</h1>
    </>
  )
}

export default Header
```
- New Component Steps:
    1. Create the component function expression
    2. Return JSX
    3. Export the component
- Return to src/App.js
    - We need to call the component in the App.js file
    - We do this by importing the component at the top
    - Example:
    ```jsx
    import React from "react"
    import Header from "./component/Header"

    const App = () => {
    return (
        <>
        <Header />
        </>
    )
    }

    export default App
    ```

## Challenges:
As a developer, you are tasked with creating an application to share your favorite things. Decide which favorite things you would like to showcase. When creating a project it is important to think about organization of your code. It is best practice to separate and compartmentalize all the actions in your code into individual components.

ðŸ“š User Stories
- As a user, I can see a Header component with the title of your app.
- As a user, I can see a Profile component with information about you and your partner.
- As a user, I can see a Footer component with the name of your cohort.
- As a user, I can see a Favorites component with a list of top five favorites (i.e. top five favorite TV shows, top five favorite songs, top five favorite taco shops).
- As a user, I can see a browser tab with a customized name and favicon.
