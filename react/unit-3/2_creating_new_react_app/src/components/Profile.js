                <p>&emsp;My name is Sam. My background comes from customer service and management.  A few years back I decided to take a chance on myself and fulfill a life-long dream to transition into programming.  So I went back to school, FIU, and received a bachelor's in Computer Science.</p>

                <p>&emsp;What intrigues me the most about programming, is the problem-solving aspect.  At times it may be difficult to solve a problem, but I'm a true believer that there is a solution to every problem.  There is no better feeling, than finding a solution to a problem.  This is what really attracted me to programming.</p>

                <p>&emsp;My problem-solving skills, along with my background in management and customer service would make me a valuable asset in your organization.  I understand the importance of working on a team and providing the best product to our customers, but, when necessary, I am able to work on my own and be accountable.</p>
